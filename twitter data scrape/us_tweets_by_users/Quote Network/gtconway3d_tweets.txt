who'da thunk it"	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2022-04-12 13:14:24+00:00	Biden will get all the blame today, but in truth, as in the 70s, it's a multi-administration problem. We shouldn't forget the astounding increase in deficit spending that Trump engaged in even before covid, as well as his jawboning of the Fed in 2019 to help his re-election bid.	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2022-03-05 15:01:27+00:00	"💯 percent.

His behavior in this regard doesn't seem to make sense from a covid-protocol point.

But from the standpoint of avoiding a Wolfsschanze scenario, it makes perfect sense."	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2022-03-02 19:31:01+00:00	Gosh, it's really too bad there isn't some way of getting protection from covid without actually getting covid. 🤔	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2022-02-12 21:35:09+00:00	I think I read somewhere that apparently there is some big country just south of Canada where lots of people aren't vaccinated and have covid, and the Canadians are concerned that truckers crossing the border from this other place might bring back the disease.	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2022-02-04 12:52:58+00:00	@Alyssafarah @AdamRippon Also 😂 for his description of the COVID testing	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2022-01-10 00:01:07+00:00	"Imagine this.

“In March, Tucker Carlson flew to Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago Club … to warn of the seriousness of the virus. Carlson told Trump he might lose the election because of covid-19, while Trump [said] that the virus wasn’t as deadly as people were claiming.”"	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-06-27 12:49:28+00:00	Historians won’t have any problem figuring out the principal reason for America’s botched response to covid-19.  There’s an almost daily public record of it.	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-06-23 20:17:37+00:00	It’s been 118 days since @realDonaldTrump said covid-19 cases “would go down to zero,” 61 days since he suggested doctors inject household cleaning solutions into people, 3 days since he said he slowed down testing, and 6 hours since he said he wasn’t kidding about that.	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-05-28 00:48:37+00:00	"The @TrumpDeathClock is pretty good. It provides a running estimate of the number of people who died of covid-19 because @realDonaldTrump spent weeks saying that we’d have zero cases and that the virus would miraculously disappear.

2020-05-22 02:07:38+00:00	@jaketapper Right? Before covid-19 a mask was just a mask.	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-05-21 01:27:38+00:00	“Fifteen times in January and February, Mr. Trump lauded Mr. Xi’s leadership on Covid-19. He fawned, ‘ ... I want to thank President Xi,’ and insisted that ‘they are doing a very professional job,’ despite strong evidence of China’s deceptive handling of the virus. “	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-05-08 10:57:40+00:00	Now, with his mishandling of covid-19, @realDonaldTrump‘s Trump’s lying, his self-regard, his self-soothing, his lack of empathy, his narcissistic rage, his contempt for norms, rules, laws, facts and simple truths — have all come home to roost.	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-05-08 10:52:24+00:00	"Americans died from covid-19 at the rate of about one every 42 seconds during the past month. 

That ought to keep any president awake at night.

But what keeps @realDonaldTrump up  is his obsession about ... @realDonaldTrump, which I wrote about here."	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-05-05 10:40:49+00:00	I guess we know what keeps the president of the United States up at night. It isn’t the Americans who are dying once every 45 seconds of covid-19.	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-05-04 14:08:49+00:00	.@realDonaldTrump is making claims about what he was and wasn’t told about covid-19.  Fine, let’s see it all:	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-04-29 15:13:06+00:00	Next time, the pollsters should ask the Biden supporters how excited they are to vote against Trump—and give them the option “I will crawl on broken glass through a covid ward to vote against the incompetent and deranged Orange menace.”  Let’s see how those numbers shake out.	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-04-23 08:04:42+00:00	“Major catastrophes lay bare the truth about our leaders. Trump’s criminally negligent, chaotic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed, once and for all, that he is a corrupt, narcissistic psychopath.”	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-04-14 00:31:53+00:00	AND .... remember what @realDonaldTrump said on **𝐌𝐀𝐑𝐂𝐇 𝟖** to GOP donors at Mar-a-Lago (shortly before it was closed because of covid-19): https://t.co/wr8E9oycMh	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-04-08 03:03:45+00:00	"“[T]he ME’s office is not testing dead bodies for COVID-19. Instead, they’re referring suspected cases to the city’s health department as ‘probable.’ …

“But the health department does not include that number in the official count unless it is confirmed ....”"	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-04-08 03:03:41+00:00	“As of Monday afternoon, 2,738 New York City residents have died from ‘confirmed’ cases of COVID-19, according to the city Department of Health. That’s an average of 245 a day since the previous Monday.”	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-03-13 02:30:40+00:00	So Fox News viewers are hearing tonight that COVID-19 is the fault of ... Joe and Hunter Biden?? https://t.co/AflEtbTjVF	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
2020-03-11 14:51:22+00:00	What?  @realDonaldTrump said just yesterday that COVID-19 will simply “go away.”	https://twitter.com/gtconway3d
