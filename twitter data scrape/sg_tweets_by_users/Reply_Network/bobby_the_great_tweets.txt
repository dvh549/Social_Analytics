2022-12-12 15:58:10+00:00	@sheryl0_C I think the people are sick with covid. Most  people I know in Beijing has covid now 🤭. Not really sure how it spread so fast, I travel to so many places in the last 6 months and didn’t get it. Probably because I still wear a mask.	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great

People are frustrated lah"	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-11-27 19:40:31+00:00	@zhao_dashuai The situation in China is so dire that no foreign interference is needed. What all my Chinese 人 tell me, is that few real leaders are stepping up to lead the protests. Slowly they are, so more and more protests will take place and hopefully no more of those dumb covid policies	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great

China is just stubborn and doesn’t want to admit they were wrong. They had the chance early this year 😤"	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-10-08 03:38:30+00:00	@Shineling2 @Alisaisil i didn’t mention anything about the US. I mentioned a few countries where I traveled to recently… and the situation in all of them is like covid doesn’t exist anymore	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-10-08 03:22:08+00:00	@Shineling2 @Alisaisil The world move on from covid … i traveled to a few places last month … singapore is ok, 🇮🇳 is doing ok, ethiopia is just fine, 🇪🇸, 🇳🇱, romania, france also very ok … china move lets on already… anyway i’m going to 🇨🇳 in 2 weeks lets see if these nonsense measures are there🤦🏻‍♂️	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-10-08 03:19:00+00:00	@Alisaisil The moved on from covid … just see singapore	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-10-08 02:38:51+00:00	@globaltimesnews The whole world moved on from covid a year ago … just look at singapore	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-08-11 09:44:22+00:00	@NikkeiAsia First you say only 5000 people came to japan, then the covid recovery is really bad and now you say it’s in full swing … your journalism really sucks	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-08-06 13:33:00+00:00	@AndyBxxx Covid is still a thing? 🤭 some people in singapore wish to get it, that way you get 3 days medical leave without showing a medical cert 😁	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-08-03 08:33:30+00:00	"@Illdbqp Actually there is something called natural selection. You can’t hold back 1.4 bil ppl because of some weak old people that could die from a simple cold.

China is really screwing itself because of these covid policies…"	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-04-06 05:04:16+00:00	"@XiaohengC @kickass0701 @albertleeer @AndyBxxx What are you talking about? I got Sinovac in Singapore and got covid … was a mild cold. And i know ppl in Cambodia with sinovac - covid was like a simple flu (even before Omicron).
So that low efficacy is plain BS. China is 90% 💉(kids under 3, some rural and by choice are not) https://t.co/4FuqHwzZML"	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-04-06 02:33:17+00:00	@XiaohengC @kickass0701 @albertleeer @AndyBxxx Same as in singapore. If vaccinated what is the issue? I know people 80+ got covid and they didn’t even need to go to the hospital…	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-04-04 04:34:03+00:00	@olalakl2 Even sinovac works well. I had covid and felt like a mild cold. https://t.co/m18kagvRjp	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-04-03 13:10:38+00:00	@DividedStatesO4 @nogood_english @SweetSummerSN @olalakl2 Lol Korea’s economy = samsung, and Japan’s economy = however long the aging population can still work, right now the only economy still ok is China’s. But china needs to find another solution to covid, maybe look at something similar to singapore	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-04-02 16:07:45+00:00	"@96Stats @AndyBxxx Depends on variant, and if 💉 or not. 

I had covid recently, i was 💉 with Sinovac and it does feel like a very mild cold (3 days). But another friend of mine was also 💉 (pfizer) and his symptoms were severe (7 days). 

I’m hoping to see an intelligent system rolled out in 🇨🇳"	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-04-02 08:53:24+00:00	"@RHKFather2 @olalakl2 It’s stupid and primitive. Everyone should get a free self test kit from the gov’t. If have Covid then self quarantine.
I had covid, had two Sinovac shots, self quarantined &amp; all good.
They did a great job controlling it until everyone got💉, now it’s time for the next phase lah https://t.co/OrhQhkrYkb"	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-04-02 04:32:26+00:00	"@AndyBxxx @aginnt 1/ Like I said a few weeks ago. People are getting fed up with covid crap … if this government doesn’t get its act together… a lot will happen. It’s like a powder keg … seriously

They had two years to come up with an exit strategy, now they have no excuses… https://t.co/jPrIJm9nmd"	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-04-02 04:06:39+00:00	@aginnt I’ve been saying this for weeks. Actually from my circle of people in 🇨🇳, things are actually reaching the boiling point. If china doesn’t sort this covid nonsense out fast, there’s going to be a lot of shit going down. They had f’ing two years to come up with an exist strategy🤦🏻‍♂️	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-03-15 05:58:21+00:00	"@taipao_tang @CarlZha I can’t comment on any model except 🇨🇳, 🇸🇬 and where i’m from.
新加坡 made some mistakes when they eased the restrictions, but after every person in 🇸🇬 got a free test package and instructions it has improved. 
FYI: the covid ☠️ rate is lower than the flu

2022-03-14 16:08:58+00:00	@Jerry_grey2002 @BarrettYouTube @Tom_Fowdy 1/ That’s true not all people, but a lot of people in my circle they are sighing. They used to appreciate how it’s handled, but lately they feel the gov’t didn’t have an exit strategy. From the details I’m getting now the 🇨🇳 gov’t is implementing Singapore’s post covid model.	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
2022-03-14 13:53:40+00:00	@BarrettYouTube @Tom_Fowdy My comment to CGTN … the covid restrictions  are no longer efficient and are becoming futile. They should have the home test kits and delivered months ago … same as here in singapore. If they don’t get this situation under control I feel something might happen … https://t.co/jxTDtYxv2d	https://twitter.com/bobby_the_great
