2020-05-14 08:02:41+00:00,@Jo_Weldon2 Slightly less an annual fee than nurses. But given many New Zealand families have had their livelihoods lost due to covid or suffered severe hardships I think this is one cause where putting up a fight over a relatively small amount is not a good look.,https://twitter.com/traintheteacher

My point is New Zealand dodged a massive bullet. 

Most kiwis don‚Äôt know anyone with covid or who died from covid. I know of at least two people under 50 and a couple of people who got it.",https://twitter.com/traintheteacher
2020-05-08 01:34:17+00:00,@lancewiggs I know of two people. But none New Zealand based. Also had covid in our parent community and worked to support family as Singapore preventively hospitalises everyone until two negative tests and that can take 5-6 weeks!,https://twitter.com/traintheteacher
